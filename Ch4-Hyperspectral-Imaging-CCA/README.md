# Coralline-Algae-VISIBLE-Spectra
The visible-spectra (400 - 800 nm) of the Antarctic coralline algae T. antarcticum: Coupling hyperspectral imaging with standard pigment and DNA tools.

## Description of project
The project aimed to quantify and analyze the content of R-phycobilins in crustose coralline algae (CCA) using hyperspectral imaging combined with DNA barcoding and pigment extractions. The study focused on the Tethysphytum antarcticum species collected from two different shallow benthic locations within the Ross Sea, Antarctica. The goal was to reveal distinct R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) spatial distributions present in two site-specific CCA phenotypes, with thin and thick crusts, respectively.

## Project Data or Deliverables
- Hyperspectral imaging data
- DNA barcoding data
- Pigment extraction data
- Spectral indices data

## Steps from field to end result
1. CCA samples collected using ROV
2. Samples stored in wrapped in soft cloth with sillica beads in the dark for 8 months
3. Specimens cleaned and inspected under stereoscope
4. Hyperspectral imaging
5. DNA barcoding
6. Pigment extractions
7. Spectral indices developed and regressed against R-phycobilins contents
8. Analysis of differences in the microspatial distribution of R-PE in two distinct phenotypes of T. antarcticum

## Strengths & weaknesses (reservations)
**Strengths**:
- Non-destructive method for quantifying pigments in CCA
- Reveals distinct spatial distributions of pigments in CCA
- Can be applied in laboratory studies and potentially in in situ surveys using underwater hyperspectral imaging systems

**Weaknesses**:
- Limited taxonomic coverage
- Limited geographic coverage
